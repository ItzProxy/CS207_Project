/* Hue EEPROM Storage Exercise
 * Written Nov 15 2011 by Alex Clarke
 *
 *Completed program will use a button to cycle through color hues.
 *When the button is released the current hue will be stored to EEPROM
 *
 *Pins 9 10 and 11 should be connected to the Red, Green and Blue pins of an
 *RGB LED.
 *The remaining pin on the LED should be connected to ground.
 *
 *Pin 12 should be connected to one side of a button.
 *The other side of the button should be connected to ground.

/* function: hsv2rb
 *   This function converts a color in hsv form to rgb form
 *   Based on the description provided on Wikipedia:
 *     http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=HSL_and_HSV&oldid=456731840#From_HSV
 * Inputs:
 *    - h: hue. Must be between 0 and 359 inclusive. 
 *              If it is outside this range the color returned will be black.
 *    - s: saturation. Must be between 0 and 1 inclusive.
 *              s is clamped if it is out of range.
 *    - v: value. Must be between 0 and 1 inclusive.
 *              v is clamped if it is out of range.
 *
 * Outputs:
 *    - r: red. Value will be between 0 and 255 inclusive.
 *    - g: green. Value will be between 0 and 255 inclusive.
 *    - b: blue. Value will be between 0 255 inclusive.
